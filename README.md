Creating a R Shiny App for UNC Alert Carolina

About Alert Carolina
Alert Carolina, a safety and awareness initiative launched in 2008, plays an instrumental role in supporting the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâ€™s overall efforts to communicate about an emergency or a situation affecting the safety and health of the campus community.

In an emergency or dangerous situation, the University will post safety-related announcements at this website, alertcarolina.unc.edu, along with updates, information, and other resources.

Aware of the limitations of email communication, I designed an R-Shiny version that conveys the exact same message from Alert Carolina. While my lab and I don't have access to the database, this R Shiny App provides us inspiration on how to visualize emergencies to help make better decisions when there's potential danger around you. In the future, if we have the potential chance to collaborate with UNC's Police System and its internal database, we can further promote this R-Shiny App through an automated database with the most updated emergency information.

One of the biggest concerns most students have with regard to Alert Carolina is that: I have no idea where the place is. Is this robbery close to me? What's the trace of this theft? What's this adverse weather's potential affected area? Because Alert Carolina conveys these emergency messages via email, students can't have a straightforward understanding of the geographics of these cases. 

By constructing this R-Shiny App, every end-user can adjust the visualization based on timeline selection, emergency type, and geographic location. It helps them to make better decisions on what the danger level for them right now and what corresponding actions need to be taken.
